    <h1>Project Freud(e)</h1>
    <p>
        Project Freud(e) is a project to gamify psychological experiments. The goal is to raise ecological validity and
        to
        make research accessible to more researcher. This is a fully independent project with no associations. The
        collection of data doesn't rely on funding.
        This app is heavily reliant on <a href="https://www.jspsych.org/">jsPsych</a>. I thank all the contributors to
        <a href="https://www.jspsych.org/">jsPsych</a>.
