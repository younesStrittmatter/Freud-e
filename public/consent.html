        hello and welcome to project Freud(e). this app is collecting data for research. We aim to get a better
        understanding of human behavior
        and mental processes. For this purpose, in the games on this side, your behavior will be measured (e. g.
        choices, reaction times).
    </p>

        Your participation in is <strong>voluntary</strong>. You may withdraw your consent to
        participate at any time without giving reasons and without prejudice.

    <p>
        The <strong>results and anonymized data collected in this study might be published in a scientific
        publication</strong>. This will happen in an <strong>anonymized format</strong> so that no data can be
        traced back to a specific person. The completely <strong>anonymized data of this study will be made
        available to other researchers and/or on the internet</strong> via the data archive Open Science
        Framework (OSF). By doing so, this study follows the recommendations of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft
        (DFG, German Research Foundation) and the Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Psychologie (DGPS, German Psychological
        Society) regarding quality assurance in research.
